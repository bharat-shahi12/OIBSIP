This project is Java-based number guessing game.
The program generates a random number within a user-defined range, and the player has to guess it.
After each guess, the program provides hints — whether the guessed number is too high or too low — until the correct number is guessed.
It also count how many attempts that we used taken by the player to win.

The project demonstrates the use of:

Random numbers (Random class)

User input handling (Scanner class)

Loops and conditional statements for game logic

The random number changes with every execution, making each game unique.

The Project demonstrates the use of:-
      1. Random numbers
      2. User Input Handling
      3. Loops and conditional statements

The output will execute different that means random number changes with every execution.
